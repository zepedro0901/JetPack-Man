# GameJam-JetPack-Man

Introducing "JetPack Man"

This was my first real project, after 3 weeks of learning Java and the objective was to create a game in 5 days.
Inspired on the famous "Flappy Bird" i designed a similar game using the simple-graphics (https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics) library!
